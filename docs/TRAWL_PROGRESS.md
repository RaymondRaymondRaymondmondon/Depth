# The Trawl: build log

Design: `The_Trawl_Reference/The Trawl — Arcade Game 2 Design Document (Draft).pdf` (50 pages). Numbers live in
`src/trawl_data.cpp` (and, from stage 3, species records in `data/trawl/trawl_species.json`).

Build order (the design doc's own):

| Stage | Work | Gate | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The boat alone: hull physics, engine, stations, top-down deck, movement, one player | The boat rolls, lists under weight, and sinks when flooded | **Done** (`--trawl-boat-test`) |
| 2 | Lines and fishing: Verlet lines, cast, bite, fight, landing against a dummy fish | `--trawl-fight` numbers in range | |
| 3 | Ecosystem port: the water column, light layer, vibration, Wake, the Lagoon's species | `--trawl-eco lagoon` curves stable with no crew | |
| 4 | The session loop: dock, Chandler, sail, clock, sell, quota | A solo night on the Lagoon is playable end to end | |
| 5 | Networking: six players, voice, prediction for reeling | `--net-loop trawl` and a six-player LAN night | Needs the shared arcade networking layer |
| 6-10 | Shooting, the net, set gear, death and ghosts; the Weeds and the Grotto; diving and wrecks; Atlantis Waters, the Kraken, the Ghost Ship; tuning and sound | | |

## Stage 1: the boat alone

Code: `src/trawl.h` (the headless core: `Sea`, `Boat`, `Crew`, `Gannet`), `src/trawl_boat.cpp` (physics),
`src/trawl_data.cpp` (numbers, stations), `src/trawl_art.cpp` (pixel art), `src/trawl.cpp` (the scene).

- **The sea**: four directional waves (a Gerstner-style sum) whose amplitude is the weather's swell (Calm 0.2 m,
  Fog 0.3, Rain 0.6, Squall 1.5, Storm 3, the Glass flat); a wind and a current push the boat.
- **The hull**: a rigid body on the surface (position, heading, velocity, yaw) plus roll, pitch and heave as damped
  springs toward a target set by eight hull points against the waves and by every weight aboard. Each `Load` (a
  hand, a fish, the hold, the net) sits at a deck position, so five hands at the port rail list her to port (3.2 deg)
  and three tonnes of net on the stern lift the bow (2.6 deg). Bilge water sloshes to the low side and eats her
  stability (free surface), so a flooding boat lists harder as she fills.
- **Damage**: six sections at integrity 0-100; below 40 a section leaks (up to 60 kg/s), below 10 it floods
  (140 kg/s); green water comes over a rail she puts under or when she's on her beam (35 deg). She founders when
  her freeboard goes. A patch kit stops a section's leak until it's hit again; the bilge pump takes 22 kg a stroke.
- **The engine**: coal shovelled from the bunker into the firebox burns hotter the fuller the firebox is; the
  telegraph (slow astern, stop, slow, half, full) draws pressure into the shaft. Green gives full thrust; red for
  more than 5 s blows the relief valve (a fire, steam, and 20 s with the screw stopped). A sack (18 kg) runs her
  182 s at half (the doc: "about 3 minutes"). The screw's noise by telegraph (0/2/5/9) is ready for the web.
- **The crew**: top-down, 8-way at 3 m/s; past 12 deg of roll an unbraced hand slides to the low side, past 25 deg
  they fall, braced (Shift, or at a station) they hold; on her beam ends a hand at the rail goes over it. The
  ladder abaft the wheelhouse goes down to the engine room (boiler, bunker, bilge pump).
- **Stations** (the doc's list, laid out on a 22 x 6 m deck): the helm (A/D rudder, W/S or scroll telegraph), the
  boiler (left mouse shovels, right mouse bleeds), the bilge pumps work now; the rods, the net winch, the lantern,
  the sonar, the cannon, the gutting table, the air pump, the bell and the printer are placed and wait for their
  stages. One hand per station. The Bosun works 25% faster at the boiler and the pump and sees the six sections.
- **Art**: the deck is drawn in the boat's own frame at 12 canvas pixels a metre into the pixel canvas (twice the
  parkour scale on screen), bow to the right, so the planks stay crisp while the sea turns under her. The sea is
  black outside the lights (the lantern mast's 14 m pool, less in fog; the wheelhouse; the stern lamp), with swell
  bands, crest foam, a wake and foam along the hull, most on the low side; the view rides a few pixels toward the
  low side as she heels. The wheelhouse roof comes off when you're inside; below decks the deck darkens and the
  engine room shows (the firebox glowing with the fire, the pressure gauge's colour, the coal, water in her, steam
  when the valve blows). HUD: a telegraph dial and heading at the helm, a pressure gauge and the coal at the
  boiler, each section's state at the pumps; nothing else, on purpose.
- The arcade's reel now sails the Gannet solo ("Sail (solo)"). Shots: `--shots shots trawl_` (deck, engine room,
  wheelhouse, squall). `--trawl-boat-test`: 20 checks (the squall rolls her to about 19 deg, the Glass holds her
  still, the port-rail list, the net trim, making way on steam, the valve, the sack's burn time, a leak against one
  pump, two flooding sections sinking her, a patch, sliding, falling, going over the rail, the ladder and stations).
